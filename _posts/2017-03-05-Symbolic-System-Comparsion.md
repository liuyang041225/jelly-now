## What is Symbolic System? 

such as theano, tensorflow and pytorch

## speed 

complied: pytorch is fast since it is a typical define-by-fun framework
complied: theano and tensorflow clearly need a complied process to implement the static graph building 

## how to build graph?

# varaiable 

# function


## how to backward? automatic?


## multiple gpu supported? how?

## Chain

## Dynamic Graph vs Static Graph
