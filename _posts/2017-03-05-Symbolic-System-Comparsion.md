## What is Symbolic System? 

such as theano, tensorflow and pytorch

## speed 

complied: pytorch is fast since it is a typical define-by-fun framework
complied: theano and tensorflow clearly need a complied process to implement the static graph building 

## how to build graph?

pytorch : how to check the graph? 
variable.creator (input,_function_,output) --> previous_function
the pytorch is a python framework based on c_api, which makes it faster than other framework


## varaiable 

## function


## how to backward? automatic?


## multiple gpu supported? how?



## Chain

## Dynamic Graph vs Static Graph

scan vs. loop
